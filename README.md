# hey! great to see you found my site. You'll notice there are a few areas that still need work, however most of the site is relatively functional and ready to look at (albeit there isn't much functionality as of yet).

# I've since been working on a new project which means I can learn from the mistakes and limitations of this site... meaning I'll incorporate PHP and potentially look into linking to MySQL for any database requirements. For now, the site looks decent. The code isn't as sophisticated as the new one however so the PHP will help reduce any redundancies and repetitive code (header, footer and whatnot).

# if you are viewing the site on mobile, this is also in my plans to optimise - I appreciate it is certainly not compatible right now!
