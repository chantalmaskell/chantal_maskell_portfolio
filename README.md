# hey! great to see you found my site. You'll notice there are a few areas that still need work, however most of the site is functional and ready to look at (albeit there isn't much functionality as of yet).

# my private notion roadmap contains plenty of features where I can re-integrate JavaScript for interactivity elements such as within the contact form, and some more experimential elements where I can look to improve the use of JS.

# if you are viewing the site on mobile, this is also in my plans to optimise - I appreciate it is certainly not compatible right now!
