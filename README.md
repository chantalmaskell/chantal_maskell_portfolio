# Portfolio Site - PHP, MySQL

First iteration of a portfolio site to showcase general experience and projects.

## Background

Currently working on updating this site to the new version with cleaner and more readable code. The next update incorporates PHP and will link to MySQL for database requirements. Applying PHP will help reduce any redundancies and repetitive code and will allow quick site updates in the future.

Optimisation for other devices will also be applied with the next update.
